Auto-Encoder\n","\n","Before implementing the full VAE, we will first implement an **auto-encoder architecture**. Auto-encoders feature the same encoder-decoder architecture as VAEs and therefore also learn a low-dimensional representation of the input data without supervision. In contrast to VAEs they are **fully deterministic** models and do not employ variational inference for optimization.\n","\n","The **architecture** is very simple: we will encode the input image into a low-dimensional representation using fully connected layers for the encoder. This results in a low-dimensional representation of the input image. This representation will get decoded back into the dimensionality of the input image using a decoder network that mirrors the architecture of the encoder. The whole model is trained by **minimizing a reconstruction loss** between the input and the decoded image.\n","\n","Intuitively, the **auto-encoder needs to compress the information contained in the input image** into a much lower dimensional representation (e.g. 28x28=784px vs. nz embedding dimensions for our MNIST model). This is possible since the information captured in the pixels is *highly redundant*. E.g. encoding an MNIST image requires <4 bits to encode which of the 10 possible digits is displayed and a few additional bits to capture information about shape and orientation. This is much less than the $255^{28\\cdot 28}$ bits of information that could be theoretically captured in the input image.\n","\n","Learning such a **compressed representation can make downstream task learning easier**. For example, learning to add two numbers based on the inferred digits is much easier than performing the task based on two piles of pixel values that depict the digits.\n","\n","In the following, we will first define the architecture of encoder and decoder and then train the auto-encoder model."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"akSPKMJ0l3rD"},"source":["## Defining the Auto-Encoder Architecture [6pt]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":20,"metadata":{"id":"rteiFTqfuvTu"},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch.nn as nn\n","\n","# Prob1-1: Let's define encoder and decoder networks\n","class Encoder(nn.Module):\n","  def __init__(self, nz, input_size):\n","    super().__init__()\n","    self.input_size = input_size\n","    ################################# TODO #########################################\n","    # Create the network architecture using a nn.Sequential module wrapper.        #\n","    # Encoder Architecture:                                                        #\n","    # -

Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE)\n","\n","Variational auto-encoders use a very similar architecture to deterministic auto-encoders, but are inherently storchastic models, i.e. we perform a stochastic sampling operation during the forward pass, leading to different different outputs every time we run the network for the same input. This sampling is required to optimize the VAE objective also known as the evidence lower bound (ELBO):\n","\n","$$\n","p(x) > \\underbrace{\\mathbb{E}_{z\\sim q(z\\vert x)} p(x \\vert z)}_{\\text{reconstruction}} - \\underbrace{D_{\\text{KL}}\\big(q(z \\vert x), p(z)\\big)}_{\\text{prior divergence}}\n","$$\n","\n","Here, $D_{\\text{KL}}(q, p)$ denotes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior distribution $q(z \\vert x)$, i.e. the output of our encoder, and $p(z)$, the prior over the embedding variable $z$, which we can choose freely.\n","\n","For simplicity, we will choose a unit Gaussian prior again. The first term is the reconstruction term we already know from training the auto-encoder.

In comparison to the auto-encoder objective, the VAE adds a regularizing term between the output of the encoder and a chosen prior distribution, effectively forcing the encoder output to not stray too far from the prior during training. As a result the decoder gets trained with samples that look pretty similar to samples from the prior, which will hopefully allow us to generate better images when using the VAE as a generative model and actually feeding it samples from the prior (as we have done for the AE before).\n","\n","The coefficient $\\beta$ is a scalar weighting factor that trades off between reconstruction and regularization objective.
